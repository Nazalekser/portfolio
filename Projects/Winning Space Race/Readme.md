Background and context
* Space X has the best launch prices for Falcon 9 rockets ($62 million vs. $165 million USD for others) due to the reuse of the first stage. 
* Space Y wants to compete with Space X

Problem
It is necessary to study the success stories Space X and the best possible launch sites so that Space Y will have lower failure rate.

The launch success rate may depend on many factors such as payload mass, orbit type, and so on. It may also depend on the location and proximities of a launch site, i.e., the initial position of rocket trajectories.

Conclusions:
* SPACE Y companies might be advised to start by launching not very large loads, as they are the ones with the highest success rate based on the SPACE X story.
* It should launch from the KSC-LC 39A launch site, which has had more successful launches than the others.
* It should choose orbits with higher launch success rates: ORBIT GEO, HEO, SSO, ES-L1
* The longer SPACE Y takes to make launches, the higher its success rate will be.
* Based on the history of SPACE X, our best model, the decision tree classifier, can predict the outcome of launches with about 94.4% accuracy.
