## Projects:

### [Deep Q-Learning - Lunar Lander](https://github.com/Nazalekser/portfolio/blob/main/Projects/Luna_Lander_Project/Lunar_Lander.ipynb)
* Land the lander safely on the landing pad using OpenAI's Gym Library.
* The agent has 4 discrete actions available and its observation space consists of a state vector with 8 variables. The total reward of an episode is the sum of the rewards for all the steps within that episode.
* The project uses a Target Network (with soft update weights) and Experience Replay techniques to avoid instabilities.
