# When users post an update on social media,such as a URL, image, status update etc., other users in 
# their network are able to view this new post on their news feed. Users can also see exactly when 
# the post was published, i.e, how many hours, minutes or seconds ago.

# Since sometimes posts are published and viewed in different time zones, this can be confusing.
# You are given two timestamps of one such post that a user can see on his newsfeed in the following format:
# Day dd Mon yyyy hh: mm: ss + xxxx
# Here + xxxx represents the time zone. Your task is to print the absolute difference (in seconds)
# between them.
